# Step 1: check that the MSA doesn't contain anormalities
# - No repeated sequences
# - No repeated names
# - No MSA columns where there are only gaps
python3 delete_allgap_cols.py <YOUR_MSA>.afa > <YOUR_MSA>.afa


# Step 2: transform FASTA into PHYLIP with
python3 fasta2phylip.py <YOUR_MSA>.afa --codenames  >   <YOUR_MSA>.phy
# (This will also remove all insertions)
# This will create a file <YOUR_MSA>_codenames.txt that contains the table associating each codename to a sequence name

# Step 3: run PhyML by changing these options (in this order!):
- Data type -> AA
- Optimise tree topoLOGy -> no
- Optimise branch lengths -> no
- Approximate likelihood ratio test -> no
# This will generate a Newick tree file (<YOUR_MSA>.phy_phyml_tree.txt) but the names of the sequences are coded!

# Step 4: put back the real sequence names instead of the codenames
python3 rename <YOUR_MSA>_codenames.txt <YOUR_MSA>.phy_phyml_tree.txt
# This will produce a file <YOUR_MSA>.phy_phyml_tree.txt.wl.nhx which is the one to use with iTOL
